Here are some steps:\n\n1. **Grant permission**: You need to grant me permission to access your personal data and tools through the Ollama's Tools API.\n2. **Choose an API endpoint**: I can use various endpoints from the Ollama's Tools API, such as `csv-parser`, `json-formatter`, or `file-manager`.\n3. **Pass data**: When using an endpoint, you need to pass relevant data to me. For example, when using `csv-parser`, you would pass a CSV file path or content.\n4. **Call the API**: Once I have the necessary data and permissions, I can call the chosen API endpoint to perform the desired action.\n\nSome examples of what we could do with Ollama's Tools API include:\n\n*   **CSV parsing**: Using the `csv-parser` endpoint, you could pass a CSV file or content, and I would parse it for you.\n*   **JSON formatting**: With the `json-formatter` endpoint, you could pass a JSON object or content, and I would format it for you.\n\nTo get started, which API endpoint would you like me to use?
